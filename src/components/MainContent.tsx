                <h1>Hello There and Welcome,</h1>
                <p>My name is Burhan (like "bur" as in being cold and "han" as in "Han Solo"). I'm glad you're visiting my site.</p>
                <p>Let me first say that this site was orginally built as somewhat of a CV and to tell you who I am, and to be honest I thought that would be a little too boring. So, I decided make a site where it can be a win-win situation. In other words, I made site to tell you a little bit about myself and as educational for any one to learn through my notes and experiences.</p>
                <p>If you just want to get to the point and find out who this <i>"Burhan"</i> guy is - <Link to="/about">Click Here</Link> </p>
                <p>I built this app to help anyone wanting to learn coding, but also to help myself. Psychology 101, when you learn a skill, thats great, but when you learn new skills while not practicing things youâ€™ve learned before, it tends to athrophy(you start to forget). Thus, keeping notes and returning back to these notes are imporant.</p>
                <p>I will place some of my notes I accumulated over the years in lamen terms so any one can learn, while also showing my skill and knoweldge set.</p>
